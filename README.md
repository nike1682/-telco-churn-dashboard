Telco Customer Churn Dashboard

This project analyzes customer churn behavior using a real-world telecom dataset and presents insights in an interactive Tableau dashboard.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical concern for telecom companies. This dashboard explores how churn is influenced by pricing, contract types, payment methods, and tenure â€” helping identify at-risk segments.

## Tools Used
- Tableau Public
- Python (for preprocessing in Colab)

## Key Features
- Overall churn breakdown
- Churn by contract type, payment method, and tenure group
- Monthly charges distribution by churn
- Interactive filters for segmentation

## Insights
- Month-to-month contracts = highest churn
- Electronic check users churn most
- High monthly charges + low tenure = high risk
